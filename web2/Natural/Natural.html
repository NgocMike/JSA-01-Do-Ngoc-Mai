                    <h3>1. Ninh Binh</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most fascinating landscapes in Vietnam, Ninh Binh is usually overlooked for more famous places. The iconic limestone pinnacles of Vietnam jut out of rice fields in this area, giving it the name “Ha Long Bay on land”. The Van Long Nature Reserve here is an absolutely pristine wetland surrounded by the famous limestone cliffs. There are also several caves to explore including the Mua Cave and Trang An. Lastly, the Cuc Phuong National Park is over 200 sq. km of lush tropical forest and one of the country’s most important protected areas. Vietnam’s rural and authentic side is more affordable and accessible at Ninh Binh.

                        A cluster of eight islands laying 2 hours by boat off the coast of Hoi An are the Cham Islands. Hon Lao is the largest, the only inhabited island, and the one that is the most active. A UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve, the islands boast extensive forests, water coconut palms, rice paddies, coral reefs and marine life. Ideal for beach bums, visitors can scuba dive or snorkel the pristine waters, lounge on white sand beaches, or purchase local handicrafts.

                        Nestled cozily in the middle of the Annamite Mountains, Phong Nha-Ke Bang may be Vietnam’s best national park. The massive area has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its limestone plateau formations, tropical forests, extensive cave systems, grottos, and underground rivers. This park houses Hang Son Doong, the world’s largest cave explorable only via guided tour. Dark Cave boasts a zipline through the surrounding forest and a swim into the cave’s entrance. Paradise Cave has an uber-impressive collection of stalagmites and stalactites. The most popular, Phong Nha Cave, can be penetrated up to 1,500m via boat tour.

                        This park, located 180 kilometers north of Hanoi, is like a less-discovered version of Ha Long Bay. With the glassy Ba Be Lake and endless limestone karsts, Ba Be National Park is an untouched piece of Vietnam’s natural beauty. Expect jaw-dropping waterfalls, valley and mountain trekking, cave explorations, and stunning landscape heavily draped in vibrant green vegetation. Trekking, kayaking, cycling, hiking, and mountaineering dominate the activities here.

                    <p>
                        This southern Vietnamese beach town has a lot more to offer than its pretty 12km long coastline. Mui Ne is known for its impressive red and white sand dunes that lie just outside the city center. The windswept dunes can be explored on foot or by a 4-wheeler (rented on site). Fairy Stream also deserves an honorable mention. This 1-hour nature trek through the stream’s vibrant orange clay bed is a sure-fire way to get in touch with the natural world. The contrast of the bright blue sky, orange rocks, and emerald-green shrubbery is picture perfect.
