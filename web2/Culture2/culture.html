                        <h1> Vietnamese Culture</h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>Vietnamese Culture is one of the oldest culture in the World which has undergone changes almost four
                            thousands of years. Some people said Vietnam culture has influence from Chinese culture but there is
                            a
                            study shows Culture of Vietnam has its own characters and has parallel development to Chinese
                            culture.
                            Along the history of Vietnam from the Dynasty of Trieu, Dinh, Ly, Tran & Le. In the pretty much same
                            time with Chinese dynasty of Han, Duong, Tong, Nguyen.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            According to scholarly sources, the Culture of Vietnam originated from ancient Nam Viet, an ancient
                            kingdom of Giao Chi people which shared characteristics of Han Chinese cultures and the ancient Dong
                            Son
                            Culture, considered one of the most important progenitors of its indigenous culture, during the
                            Bronze
                            Age. Nam Viet was occupied by Northern evaders in 111 BC, leading to the first Chinese domination of
                            Vietnam lasting over thousand years that propelled Chinese influences onto Vietnamese culture in
                            terms
                            of Confucian philosophy governance, and the arts.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Following independence from Chinese in the 10th century; successive Vietnamese imperial dynasties
                            flourished as the country embarked on a southward expansion that annexed territories of the Champa
                            and
                            Khmer civilizations; which resulted in regional variances of modern-day culture of Vietnam. During
                            the
                            French colonial period in the mid-19th century; Vietnamese culture absorbed European influences
                            including architecture; Catholicism, and the adoption of the Latin alphabet, which created the new
                            official writing system that replaced the previous Chinese characters and Nom scripts.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After French left, Vietnamese culture was characterized by government-controlled propaganda, which
                            emphasized the importance of cultural exchanges with fellow communist nations such as the Soviet
                            Union,
                            China, and Cuba. Following the reform in 1986, Vietnam has continuously absorbed various influences
                            from
                            Asian, European, and American cultures. Part of the East Asian cultural sphere, Vietnamese culture
                            has
                            certain characteristic features including ancestor veneration and worship, respect for community and
                            family values, and manual labor religious belief. Important cultural symbols include 4 holy animals:
                            Dragons, Turtles, Phoenix, Unicorn. The national flower is lotuses and the most popular plant in
                            Vietnam
                            is bamboo.

                        1. Ethnic groups in Vietnam
                    </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Vietnam is a multiethnic country with over fifty distinct groups (54 Totally). Each of them has its
                        own
                        language, lifestyle, and cultural heritage. Many of the local ethnic groups residing in mountain
                        areas
                        are known collectively in the West as Montagnard or Degar.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The largest ethnic groups are: Kinh (Viet) 85.7%, Tay 1.9%, Tai Ethnic 1.8%, Mường 1.5%, Khmer Krom
                        1.5%, Hmong 1.2%, Nung 1.1%, Hoa 1%, with all others comprising the remaining 4.3% (2009 census).
                        The
                        Vietnamese has term for ethnic group (literally “minority people”). One distinctive feature of
                        highland
                        ethnic minority groups in Vietnam is that they are colorfully attired whether at home, in the farm,
                        traveling or in their home town.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Many ethnic groups elsewhere such as southern part of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, China, Papua
                        New
                        Guinea, and many other countries do not wear attractive clothes while engaged in their day-to-day
                        activities. The clothing of one group is quite different from that of other groups and adds color to
                        the
                        social landscape. When you travel in Vietnam, you will meet and even talk to many of them. In the
                        trip t
                        Sapa, you may see dozens of them or some province as Lai Chau has 20 ethnic groups ( more than 3
                        hundreds thousand habitats). Dak Lak province has most in Vietnam with 47 ethnic groups.

                    <h2>2. Social Beliefs & Customs in Vietnam</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Family is very strong in Vietnam. Family and clan (dòng họ) are valued over individualism. Clan is
                        the
                        most important social unit in the country and each clan features a patriarch heading the clan and a
                        clan
                        altar. Even today, in some parts of the country, the tradition of clan members living together in
                        longhouses is quite prevalent. It is also not uncommon to see three to four generations of a family
                        living together in the same house. Members of a clan are related by blood and often name their
                        villages
                        based on their clan names. Death commemorations of clan members are usually attended by all members
                        of
                        the clan and villagers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Weddings in Vietnam earlier was arranged mainly by parents and people were married very young.
                        However,
                        things have changed so much in recent years since Vietnam Open the door to the World and tourism
                        pick up
                        in early of 90. Vietnamese youth enjoy greater freedom of choosing the time of their marriage and
                        their
                        partner. Weddings are still mostly held in the traditional manner with elaborate rituals and
                        ceremonies.
                        The date for Wedding was carefully selected by Feng Shui master or most respected man in the Clan.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The traditional funeral ceremony in Vietnam is also quite elaborate and long-stretched. The body of
                        the
                        dead person is cleaned with fragrant water and dressed carefully in the special clothes. A lot of
                        mourning following and depends on each tribe and location, they have the slightly different
                        ceremony.
                        Later the body will be burying, the most popular method. Recently, some area, people choose
                        cremation
                        instead of burying. Only 1 case of remains in frozen condition and several cases of Monks body was
                        kept
                        inside the statues…
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        According to Confucian, men and women can not touch hand unless they are husband and wife so
                        Vietnamese
                        people don’t hug when meeting. They say ” Xin Chao” or handshake between men.

                        <br>
                        <br>People in the city talk gently and quietly and people come from the countryside or from the sea
                        talk
                        pretty loud. They work on the farm or ocean and they got to talk even louder than the wind or the
                        waves.

                        In reality ,religion in Vietnam has historically been largely defined by a mix of Buddhism,
                        Confucianism, and Taoism, known in Vietnamese as the Tam Giao (“triple religion”).Catholicism is

                        practiced in modern Vietnam.

                        Ancestor worship is common in Vietnamese culture. Most Vietnamese, regardless of religious

                    <br>
                    <p>Literature in Vietnam has greatly evolved over the years from romanticism to realism. Two aspects of
                        the
                        literature in the country are the folk literature and the written literature both of which developed
                        almost at the same time. Folk literature features fairytales, folk legends, humorous stories, and
                        epic
                        poems. Written literature was previously written in the Cham and Nom characters and focused on
                        poetry
                        and prose. Now, it is mostly written in the National Language and includes short stories, dramas,
                        novels, etc.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Vietnamese art is mainly influenced by Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. However, more recently,
                        the
                        Cham and French influence have also been reflected in the art presentations. Silk painting is
                        popular in
                        Vietnam and involves the liberal use of colors. Calligraphy is also a much-respected art form and
                        often,
                        during festivals like the Lunar New Year. On the third day of new year people would visit a village
                        teacher or an erudite scholar to obtain calligraphy hangings for their homes. Vietnamese wood-block
                        prints are also quite popular. Water puppetry and several forms of theaters represent other
                        performing
                        art forms in Vietnam.</p>
